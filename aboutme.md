My name is Seyong Ryoo. I am studying a master's degree in Statistics and Data Science at KU Leuven.

### Where have I been so far?
- I was born in Korea (South, not North) and went to Spain to study bachelor's degree when I was 18 years old.
- I finished my bachelor's degree and went to Belgium to study master's degree.
- Due to COVID-19, non-face-to-face classes are possible, so I decided to end the last year in Korea.

### Should I say they are hobbies?
- I like to read novels, especially classical novels. 
- I also like to go to a cafe on a good day and have coffee and sweet desserts.
- I'm not good at it, but I'm practicing the piano every day.
- I like to work out, so I'm planning to take a swimming class.

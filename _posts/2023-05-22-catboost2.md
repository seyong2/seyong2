This post is dedicated to comparing the encoding methods we saw in the previous post. If you didn't, check out [CatBoost Part 1 - How CatBoost deals with categorical features](https://seyong2.github.io/2023-05-21-catboost1/). To this end, we are going to use the [Data Science Salaries 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023) dataset and predict the gross salary of a data scientist based on different features. Without furtherado, let's get started by importing the data and have a look at the first five rows.

```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/ds_salaries.csv')
df.head()
```

| work_year | experience_level | employment_type | job_title | salary | salary_currency | salary_in_usd	| employee_residence | remote_ratio | company_location | company_size |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2023 | SE | FT | Principal Data Scientist | 80000	| EUR | 85847 | ES | 100 | ES | L |
| 2023 | MI | CT | ML Engineer | 30000	| USD | 30000 | US | 100 | US | S |
| 2023 | MI | CT | ML Engineer | 25500	| USD | 25500 | US | 100 | US | S |
| 2023 | SE | FT | Data Scientist | 175000	| USD | 175000 | CA | 100 | CA | M |
| 2023 | SE | FT | Data Scientist | 120000	| USD | 120000 | CA | 100 | CA | M |

We see that there are 11 columns in total. From the names of the columns, we can infer what each variable would represent but the table below provides more detailed explanation on the columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical phase in the journey of understanding and extracting insights from any dataset. In this context, we embark on an exploratory journey into the fascinating realm of [fish market data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/fish-market?resource=download). The dataset at our disposal encapsulates a wealth of information about various fish species, offering a unique opportunity to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that may lie beneath the surface.

As we delve into the intricacies of this dataset, our goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the different attributes associated with each fish entry. From species variations to size measurements, weight, and potentially more, EDA empowers us to visually and statistically dissect the data. Through this process, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can inform decision-making, facilitate predictive modeling, or simply enhance our knowledge of the characteristics that distinguish one fish species from another.

The journey begins with loading the data, exploring its structure, and gradually peeling back layers to reveal the nuances hidden within. Utilizing various statistical measures, visualizations, and hypothesis testing, EDA not only helps us comprehend the nuances of the fish market data but also guides us in making informed decisions and formulating meaningful questions for further analysis.

# Import Python Libraries and Data

Let's start by importing the necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
```

# Load the Dataset
```
df = pd.read_csv('fish.csv')
```

# Explore the Data

```
# Display the first few rows
df.head()
```

```
# Get information about the dataset
df.info()
```

The dataset encompasses 7 attributes detailing information about 159 fishes available in the market. The column descriptions are outlined below:

- *Species*: species name of fish
- *Weight*: weight of fish in g
- *Length1*: vertical length in cm
- *Length2*: diagonal length in cm
- *Length3*: cross length in cm
- *Height*: height in cm
- *Width*: diagonal width in cm

It's worth noting that there are no missing values in the dataset, and among the columns, only `Species` is categorical, while the rest are all numerical.

```
# Summary statistics
df.describe()
```

Upon a quick review of the summary statistics for numerical variables, it's evident that there are no apparent inconsistencies or nonsensical values within the permissible ranges for each feature.

## Species
Now, let's thoroughly examine each variable in the dataset. Our initial focus will be on the `Species` variable.

```
# Distribution of Species
species_distribution = df['Species'].value_counts().to_frame()
species_distribution = species_distribution.rename(columns={'Species': 'Number of Observations'})
species_distribution['Percentage of Observations'] = round(100*df['Species'].value_counts(normalize=True), 1)
species_distribution
```

Among the 7 distinct fish species, Perch is the most frequently observed, accounting for 35.2% of the data, trailed by Bream at 22%, and Roach at 12.6%.

## Weight

For the numerical variables, starting with `Weight`, we generate box plots for each fish type to visualize the distribution of weights.

```
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='Species', y='Weight')
```

Examining the plot, Bream emerges as the fish type with the highest median weight (approximately 630g). Nevertheless, the weight distribution of Pike displays the greatest variability, followed by Perch and Whitefish. In contrast, Smelt exhibits the smallest weights with minimal variation.

## Height

```
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='Species', y='Height')
```

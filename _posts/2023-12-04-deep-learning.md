- Deep learning is a subset of Machine Learning that tries to find pattern from data using neural networks.
- Why Deep learning?
  - Instead of hand engineering features like in traditional machine learning which is time consuming, brittle and not scalable in practice, we let the machine look at data and try to uncover the core patterns of the data.
 
- The perceptron (single neuron): the structural building block of deep learning

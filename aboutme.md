Hey there! I'm Seyong, originally from Korea but currently soaking up the vibrant vibes of Madrid, Spain, where I work as a data analyst. Wondering why I made the leap across the globe? Well, since my younger days, I dreamt of studying abroad. During a family vacation in Spain, I was captivated by its charm, and that's when the decision was made – I was destined to call Spain home. Fast forward to 2015, and here I am, living the dream!

After immersing myself in the Spanish language for a year and a half, and acing the university entrance exams, I found myself at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, delving into the world of business administration. My academic journey took me even further with exchange programs at Boston College and Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, adding exciting chapters to my story.

Fueling my passion for statistics, I pursued a master's degree at KU Leuven, Belgium, where I dived into the intricate realms of statistics and data science. Upon returning to Spain in 2022, life took an exciting turn – I tied the knot with my husband. Navigating the bureaucratic twists and turns, I secured my Spanish residency in January 2023, kicking off a thrilling chapter in my career.

In February, I dove into the dynamic world of data analytics through an internship at Procter & Gamble. Blending technical expertise with a keen business sense, I seamlessly transitioned into a full-time role after a successful stint. It's been nearly a year, and I continue to thrive in this dynamic space.

Away from the buzzing data world, I find solace in yoga, a recent love affair that helps me unwind from those screen-filled days. When not striking a pose, you'll catch me immersed in a good book, finding serenity in the pages during commutes and before bedtime.

The other day, during the flight to Zurich to spend the weekend, my husband asked me a question. 

"Do you remember how mean squared error (MSE) can be decomposed into squared-bias and variance?"

"Of course, in fact I looked it up a few days ago. Let me derive it for you."

However, even if I was quite confident about deriving the formula, I failed to recollect what I thought I had learned in the moment I grabbed the pencil... What a disaster!

After the trip to Zurich, I decided to review this concept reminding myself that this was one of the basic and main concepts in machine learning. The first thing I did, therefore, was to [watch the video by StatQuest with Josh Starmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuBBz3bI-aA).
